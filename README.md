#CodeCamp-git

##About
This repo serves as an interactive tutorial for learning the basics of git and how it can be implemented at General Mills.

##Your Task
You have been assigned a secret agent number. To officially become a General mills Secret Agent, you must add your photo and a short bio to the GMSS site.

Fork this repo, make your changes, and then submit the pull request. We will deal with merging the changes live to show you how easy it is to merge pull requests.

##General Mills Secret Service
The GMSS site is hosted on the *gh-pages* branch at [http://NoahHines.github.io/CodeCamp-git](http://NoahHines.github.io/CodeCamp-git "General Mills Secret Service"). To learn more about gh-pages, check out this [blog post](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/ "about gh-pages").

##TODO
- Practice presentation (time it!)
- Test merge conflicts with github pages so live coding runs smoothly
